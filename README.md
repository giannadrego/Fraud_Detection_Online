# Fraud Detection in Online Payments

In a period defined by digital transformation, online payments have become an essential part of our daily lives which has transformed the way we conduct transactions. The convenience and effectiveness of internet payments have empowered consumers and businesses alike, offering unparalleled access to goods and services. 

However, with this convenience comes an inherent challenge â€“ the continuous threat of fraudulent activities. The rapid growth of internet payment platforms has presented both opportunities and challenges for financial institutions, merchants, and consumers. While it has simplified transactions, it has also opened doors for sophisticated criminals who exploit vulnerabilities in the system.

In the intricate and ever-changing landscape of internet payments, the need for strong fraud detection mechanisms has become vital. This is where Machine Learning comes into the picture. This project aims to protect online payment ecosystems from malicious activities, safeguarding the interests of both businesses and consumers. 

This project uses both Logistic Regression as well as Decision Tree Classifier and compares the accuracy between the two.

Logistic Regression gives an accuracy of approximately 0.8981 (or 89.81%) 

Decision Tree Classifier an accuracy approximately 0.9924 (or 99.24%)
